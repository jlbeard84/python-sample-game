# Block Busting Clone

### Clone of the classic block busting arcade game to get familiar with Python. 

# Building
### I built the app using Python 3.7, but 3+ should work.

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
python app.py
```

#### Code adapted from the book *Python	Game Programming By Example* by *Alejandro Rodas de Paz* and *Joseph Howse*.
